    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Omnia Elnaggar.. I’m passionate about learning and building creative digital solutions..</p>

    <h3>Why I’m Learning Web Development</h3>
    <p>I joined the ALX program to become a better front-end developer and learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript..</p>

    <p>This is one of my first projects — a clean, simple webpage using just HTML!..</p>

    <p>In the future, I want to build interactive websites that help people learn and grow..</p>
